Description 

xmlrpclib is a basic XML-RPC library for Processing. XML-RPC is a widely adopted Remote Procedure Calling protocol that works over the Internet. It creates connections between procedures that are running in different applications, or on different machines. This library is based on the Apache XML-RPC 2 Java implementation that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure calls.

The XML-RPC specification is written by Dave Winer and adopted in a variety of programming languages. Check out the links below for more information about the XML-RPC protocol. 

The XML-RPC specification defines the following available data types:

XML TAG NAME		JAVA TYPE		EXAMPLE	
<i4> or <int>		Integer			3	
<boolean>			Boolean			true	
<string>			String			hello
<double>			Double			3.362	
<base64>			byte[]			eW91IGNhbid0IHJlYWQgdGhpcyE=
<dateTime.iso8601>	Date			20060726T14:08:55	
<struct>			Hashtable		{"food"="cheese", "drink"="wine"}
<array>				Vector			["boston", "istanbul", "berlin"]


Currently many web services have application programming interfaces (API) that work through the XML-RPC protocol. By using the XmlrpcClient in Processing, you can incorporate the available data and processes of these web services in your program. By using the XmlrpcServer in Processing, you can open up the methods of your program as an interface to other programs over the Internet.


Download &  Installation

xmlrpclib.zip

Extract the contents and copy the xmlrpclib folder into the "libraries" folder of your Processing installation. Upon restarting Processing xmlrpclib will be available as a public library from the "Import" menu.
