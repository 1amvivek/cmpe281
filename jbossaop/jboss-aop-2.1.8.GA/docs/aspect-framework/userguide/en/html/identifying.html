         Aspect-Oriented programming is not a replacement
         for object-oriented programming, but rather a compliment to it.  AOPers generally say that OOP solves 90% of problems
         and AOP solves the 10% of problems that OOP isn't good at.  This section of the docbook will expand over time,
         but let's discuss some ways in which you can identify whether
         or not AOP is a good solution for a particular problem.

                  <p>
                  The metrics example in the previous chapter is an example of a cross-cutting concern in its purest form.
                  Sometimes you see structure in your code that can't be expressed as an object because it completly wraps
                  around the method you are invoking.  If the behavior in question is something that you want to be able to
                  extend and maintain within its own structure then it may be a candidate for aspectizing.

               <dd>
                  <p>
                  Another place where AOP may be very useful is to layer your applications.  Sometimes you want to model
                  a particular service or object that has many configuration options yet you don't want to bloat your service
                  with unmaintainable code.  AOP provides a nice way to layer such complex services.  JBoss AOP provides
                  a XML configurable mechanism to configure such aspects per deployment.  A good example of this is
                  a caching service that might have different locking policies.  It is easier to encapsulate such
                  locking policies as aspects so that the base caching code doesn't get polluted with locking concerns.
                  This makes the code easier to maintain.

               </dt>
               <dd>
                  <p>
                  Many times you want to write plain Java code that focuses solely on business or application logic
                  and do not want to introduce any concerns like middleware.  AOP allows you to apply things like
                  middleware transparently to your code without polluting your code.  Some examples include
                  the transaction demarcation and role-based security features in the JBoss AOP Aspect Library.
