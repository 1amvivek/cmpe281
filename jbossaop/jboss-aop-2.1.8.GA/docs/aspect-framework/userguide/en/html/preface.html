            Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a new  paradigm that allows you to organize
            and layer your software applications in ways that are impossible with traditional
            object-oriented approaches.  Aspects allow you to transparently glue functionality together
            so that you can have a more layered design.  AOP allows you to intercept any event in a Java
            program and trigger functionality based on those events.  Mixins allow you to introduce
            multiple inheritance to Java so that you can provide APIs for your aspects.  Combined with
            JDK 5.0 annotations, it allows you to extend the Java language with new syntax.
      </p>
         <p>
            JBoss AOP is a 100% Pure Java aspected oriented framework usuable in any programming
            environment or as tightly integrated with  our application server.
      </p>
         <p>
           This document walks you through how AOP can be used to build your applications.  A large number of real-world examples
           are given in each section to illustrate various ideas.  The book is broken up in the
         following manner:
      </p>
         <div class="variablelist">
            <dl>
               <dt>
                  <span class="term">What is an Aspect?</span>
               </dt>
               <dd>
                  <p>
                  The section gives an overview on exactly what Aspect-Oriented Programming is.

                  Defines some basic AOP terms that you will need when reading this document.

               <dd>
                  <p>
                  The chapter walks through some examples of building an aspect.  One example shown is how to
                  detect JDBC connection leakages in your code.  Another example is using the Observer/Observable pattern
                  Another is doing dependency injection.

                  This chapter walks through how you can use JDK 5.0 annotations and AOP to actually extend the Java
                  language with new syntax.  Numerous real-world examples are given.

               <dd>
                  <p>
                  This chapter walks through how you can use AOP introductions and mixins to have aspects with APIs,
                  or how to extend a POJO's functionality transparently.  Specific examples are an Asynchronous framework
                  and making a POJO into a JMX MBean.

                  <p>
                  This chapter walks through how you can use the dynamic per-instance API that each aspectized class
                  has to define aspects on a per instance basis rather than for every instance of a class.

               <dd>
                  <p>
                  This chapter steps away from writing aspects, but rather talks about how you can publish pointcuts
                  that can be used by users/customers to integrate with your products.

                  This chapter shows how you can use AOP to test your applications in a easier way.

         In some of the example listings, what is meant to be displayed on one line does not fit
         inside the available page width. These lines have been broken up. A '\' at the end of a
         line means that a break has been introduced to fit in the page, with the following lines
         indented. So:
         </p>
         <pre class="programlisting">
   Let's pretend to have an extremely \
      long line that \
      does not fit
   This one is short
